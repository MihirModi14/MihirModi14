## 👋 Hey there!

I'm a **Frontend Developer** at SmartSense who loves building things that real people use. Currently on a journey to become a **MERN stack developer** - because understanding the full picture makes everything better.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me on mountain trails 🏔️ (that's me in my profile pic!)

**Open to:** Interesting conversations, collaborations, and exploring new opportunities ☕

---

## 🛠️ What I Work With

**Right Now:** React • TypeScript • Angular • TanStack Query • Material-UI • Docker  
**Learning:** Node.js • Express (becoming a full-stack dev!)  
**Approach:** Pick the right tool, solve the problem, keep it simple

*Plus 15+ more experiments - some polished, some learning exercises, all teaching me something*
