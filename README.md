## 👨‍💻 Who Am I?

I'm a **Frontend Developer** who believes great UIs are born from understanding both **user needs** and **system constraints**. Currently building at **SmartSense**, where I architect solutions that real people use every day.

**My approach:** Start with the problem, not the tech. Then pick the right tools to solve it elegantly.
```javascript
const currentlyDoing = {
  building: "Multi-service booking platforms that handle real traffic",
  learning: "Node.js & Backend (MERN stack journey 🚀)",
  teaching: "React patterns to fellow developers",
  exploring: "Mountain trails whenever possible 🏔️"
};
```

**Status:** Not actively job hunting, but always open to interesting conversations about tech, collaboration, or your next big idea ☕

---

## 🛠️ My Toolbox

**Building With:**
```
Frontend:    React • TypeScript • Angular
State:       TanStack Query • Redux • Context API  
Styling:     Material-UI • shadcn/ui • Tailwind CSS
Tools:       Docker • Webpack • Git
Currently:   Node.js • Express (Learning MERN)
```

**Philosophy:** Right tool for the right job. Sometimes that's React, sometimes vanilla JS, sometimes it's a napkin sketch first.

## 🎯 What I Build

### Live Projects You Can Try

🔗 **[FundFlex](https://fundflex.netlify.app/)** - Manage users and track balances  
*The problem:* Need simple balance tracking  
*The solution:* Clean UI, real-time updates, no bloat

🎮 **[SmartPoke](https://smartpoke.netlify.app/)** - Pokémon explorer  
*The problem:* PokeAPI is complex for casual fans  
*The solution:* Fun, visual way to explore Pokémon data

💰 **[Cash-Flow-Mate](https://cashflowmate.netlify.app/)** - Track your expenses  
*The problem:* Expense tracking apps are overcomplicated  
*The solution:* Simple categorization, visual insights

⏰ **[Remind-Me Extension](https://github.com/MihirModi14/Remind-Me-Extension)** - Calendar reminders 🚧  
*Currently building:* Chrome extension to never miss events

### Code Patterns & Reusable Components

Sometimes the best projects teach patterns, not just features:

- **[Multi-step Form Tabs](https://codesandbox.io/p/github/MihirModi14/vanilla-react-form-tabs)** - Step-by-step validation done right
- **[Dynamic Pagination](https://codesandbox.io/p/github/MihirModi14/vanilla-react-pagination)** - Pagination that actually scales

*Plus 15+ more experiments in my repos - some polished, some learning exercises, all teaching me something*

## 🧗 Beyond the Code

**When I'm not coding:**
- 🏔️ Hiking mountain trails (check my profile pic!)
- 💡 Thinking about system design while trekking
- 📚 Learning backend to complete my full-stack journey
- 🎓 Sharing knowledge through tech sessions

**Fun fact:** Some of my best architecture decisions happened on mountain trails. There's something about the perspective. 🌄

---

## 💭 My Learning Journey

**Current Mission:** Becoming a MERN stack developer
```
✅ Frontend: Solid foundation with React, TypeScript, Angular
🔄 Backend: Learning Node.js & Express (in progress)
📋 Next: MongoDB, REST API design patterns
🎯 Goal: Build full-stack apps end-to-end
```

**Why MERN?** Because understanding the full picture - from database to UI - makes me a better frontend developer too.

---

## 🌟 Things I Care About

- **Performance:** Users shouldn't wait. Ever.
- **Code Quality:** Future me should thank present me
- **Learning:** If I'm not learning, I'm stagnating
- **Sharing:** Knowledge grows when shared
- **Balance:** Great code comes from a refreshed mind (hence, mountains! 🏔️)
